# <h1 align="center">What is RogueMon?</h1>
| **RogueMon makes FRLG into a full Randomized Pokemon Roguelike** | 
| :--------------------: |
|The goal is to win by locking every pokemon type and finishing a run without fainting. on your journey, you'll receive prizes to help you on your way. Curses will hinder your path. All resources to get set up available in the discord listed above.|

---

## ROGUELIKES
| **Often have difficult choices and a “linear” element.** | 
| :--------------------: |
| The goal is to go straight through the game and as you do, you get offered random sets of items for achieving milestones. |
| There are randomly 'cursed' sections of the game which offer fun and interesting challenges to overcome. |
| There are ‘buy’ phases and ‘cleansing’ phases (described in rules) where you can exchange current items to upgrade them and/or win items to use on your quest for victory. |
| There will also be ‘ascensions’ or difficulty levels to progress through. |

## GAME PROGRESSION
| **Roguelikes have a “permadeath” feature and have 'growth over time' mechanics.** | 
| :--------------------: |
| The goal of the challenge is to complete the entirety of the game without your lead pokemon fainting by only fighting trainers. All stats, abilities, items, moves (learnable via level and TMs) are randomized. |
| Evolutions in RogueMon will SHARE BST distribution AND ability. Any additional BST from the evolution will be *randomly* distributed ON TOP of the previous mons. |
> Example: Charmander evolves into Combusken. The SPD gets a slight buff from the additional base stats where the DEF got nothing. Both have Mold Breaker.

---

## EVOLUTIONS 
| **All pokemon available in the game will be able to evolve at least once. Evolutions are randomized, but with some logic:** |
| :--------------------: |
| The evolution will share a type with the previous form, and will be of approximately similar BST to what it is “supposed” to become (usually within +/-10%). |
| No cancelling evolutions. Everstones are allowed if desired, if acquired by a prize. Roguestone use is a choice. |
| Base stats and ability upon evolving are carried over to the new pokemon, with the additional base stats randomly going on top. |
| In FRLG Natdex, all pokemon with a BST less than or equal to 450 that normally would not evolve are given a new evolution, in order to ensure that you can end up with something reasonably strong. This evolution will occur at the level of the BST of the evolution target divided by 10. *Note: this will not be known until the level is reached!*|
> Example: If Wobbuffet (405 BST) were to evolve into Delphox (534 BST), this evolution would occur at level 53.

---

<h1 align="center">ROGUEMON RULES</h1>

## LAB
| **Lab mons are guaranteed to be base form evolutions and will evolve at least once.** |
| :--------------------: |
| You can choose your starter in the lab. |
| All lab fights will always be Lvl.6 vs Lvl.6 |
| You will always start each run with 5 Potions. You receive 4 AUTOMATICALLY if you are using the RogueMon Tracker extension. Get the 5th from the Mart employee on Route 1. |
| The player has the option to **Either** 1) Receive 5 random pokeballs from Oak on Route 1 **OR** 2) Take 5 unique level 8 adopted pivots in Pallet Town. |

---

## WILD POKEMON
| *Wild pokemon will be any unevolved pokemon that can evolve by level,  friendship, or a game mode exclusive "Roguestone". Type can be specified in the Roguemon-randomizer.* |
| :--------------------: |
| Pokemon in the wild have a 100% catch rate. |
| Wild Pokemon have a 50% increase to their level in all ascensions. |
| NOTE: Once you fight a non-rival trainer, you are LOCKED with your current pokemon for the attempt. |
| You may catch 5 pokemon if you chose to take Oak's balls, and then choose ONE to attempt the challenge, including the same pokemon 5 times if you choose. |
| Once you select the ONE pokemon you are going to run, you may keep the item it’s holding if it has one, treating it as though you picked it up from the ground. |
| You may heal freely while you are catching your 5 pokemon. However, if your lead pokemon faints your run ends. |
| You may swap your lead pokemon at any time during this phase. You may use moves on wild pokemon, but you can’t intentionally faint them. If you do happen to defeat a wild, you cannot run the pokemon that gained experience. |
| If you are trapped and cannot escape, you can catch the pokemon that trapped you, but it counts as one of your 5 catches.If you are trapped before obtaining balls, you may KO the pokemon in good faith and continue. |
| After locking your pokemon to run, you can catch and release any wild pokemon you wish later on in the run. |
| All pokemon that evolve with any stone/item now take a "Roguestone" to evolve. Roguestones you find randomly can be kept and used at any time after gym 1. |
| **Shiny Rule** - If you are scouting your mon to run, and find a shiny, you must attempt to run it or face the wrath of Croz. You may fight wilds to get to level 8 outside of prizes, and are trusted to do your best to hit level 8 evenly. |

---

<h1 align="center">ITEMS</h1>

## GENERAL ITEM RULES
| **All ground items are randomized. There are limitations to how they are used limited to immediate pickup Shop Phase and Cleansing Phase rules (see below)** |
| :--------------------: |
| Legal items are limited to visible, hidden, and NPC gift. |
| ALL step items are banned and have been removed from the game. |
| No buying items in shops unless allowed from a prize. Repels only exception. **NO POKEBALLS!** |
| No breaking and entering. You are not permitted to enter buildings not required by story / RogueMon prize to pick up items. You may also not steal items from people's residences (e.g. the Warden and the Copycat). |
| Some prizes may also allow you to buy things such as TMs that are not automatically handled by the tracker extension. |

---

## WHEN YOU DO PICK UP AN ITEM
| **There are four types of items, each with different rules:** |
| :--------------------: |
| Healing items - items that heal you but cannot be held (e.g. Potion, Antidote, Ether) |
| Medicine - items that power up a pokemon outside of battle (e.g. Rare Candy, PP Up, Calcium) |
| Consumables - items that are held and used up in battle (e.g. Oran Berry, White Herb) |
| Other items - battle items (e.g. X Speed), plus non-consumable held items (e.g. Charcoal, Scope Lens) |

---

## HEALING ITEMS
| **You may keep it. HOWEVER, if it puts you over your current HP or status cap, you must immediately use or trash healing items (or equip berries) until you are below the HP Cap.** |
| :--------------------: |
| In the tracker, you need to toggle to display HP heals in bag as a whole number and not a percentage. (Settings>Gameplay>Options) |
| You may use the item you just picked up, or an item you already had, as long as you end up back under the limit. |
| All heals that exceed your max HP, are EQUAL to your Pokemon’s current HP. |
| Status healing berries (e.g. Pecha, Cheri) are counted in this category, NOT as consumables. |

---

## MEDICINE ITEM
| **It must be used immediately or trashed. This includes PP Ups/Maxes, Rare Candies, and Vitamins.** |
| :--------------------: |
> Exception: If you get one of these items before the first trainer, you may keep it until you have locked in your pokemon. If you do, it must be used or trashed immediately after deciding and before fighting the first trainer.

---

## CONSUMABLES
| **When you pick up any non-PP or status consumable item, you must make an immediate decision on whether to equip (or use) it or not. If you do not equip it, you must trash it. The consumable can never go back into the bag once equipped but can be used if unequipped.** |
| :--------------------: |
| Leppa Berries and status berries (e.g. Lum, Chesto) can be kept and treated as a regular PP/status heal. |
| You may choose to equip status/pp berries; if you do, then they are treated like normal consumables. |
| If the consumable replaces another consumable, the one being unequipped must be trashed/used. |
| If the consumable is replacing a won held item, the held item goes into the bag and can be re-equipped. |
| Held berries do not count against your HP/status bag limit, but berries in your bag do. |

---

## TMs
| **All TMs have full compatibility, however...** |
| :--------------------: |
| Gym TMs can be taught without restriction, but you must decide to teach immediately. |
| Ground TMs can only be taught if a prize roll ([see items](#Items)) allows you to. |

---

## OTHER ITEMS
| **Between Gyms, Items you pick up can be KEPT, temporarily – but they can’t be used yet. It’s possible you can Win/Choose to keep them via a Prize. If you don’t Win/Choose them from a prize, they will get trashed in the next Cleansing Phase.** |
| :--------------------: |
| Think of your bag as a temporary holding space for some possible items you can win when you get a prize. |
> Exception - Pre-Gym 1 held item. Until you have cleared the first gym, you may use any non-banned held items, X items, and flutes you pick up, without restrictions unless it breaks one of the core Ascension Rules. These items must all be trashed during the cleansing phase after completing Gym 1, whether or not they were used.

---

> Note: The "Found Item" prize can be used to unlock any held item, X item, flute, or TM. If you unlock a held item, it may be equipped and unequipped at will; if you unlock an X item or a flute, it may be used normally; if you unlock a TM, it may not be taught yet, but is permanently safe from being cleansed and may be taught with a "TM in bag" prize later.

---

> Revive note:  Revives are treated as being in the other items category. You may only use one if you unlock from a prize roll.
If you obtain a legal Revive, this is how to use it upon fainting: send your HM friend in, use the revive, then use moves with the HM friend until it faints.
As such, your HM friend should always be with you if you have one.
If a trainer swaps your HM friend in, you may attack with moves until it faints, but this will forfeit your ability to use a revive until you can use a Pokemon Center.
You are limited to ONE HM friend, and owning ONE revive item per run.

---

<h1 align="center">GAME PROGRESSION</h1>

| **The game mode is meant to be linear. There is FORCED ROUTING.** |
| :--------------------: |
| The game is divided into segments, which comprise one or more routes/areas. |
| Unless forced to by story, you must clear a segment in one attempt without healing at a Pokemon Center. |
| You may use the Pokemon Center upon completing any segment. |
| Healing HP, Status, and PP using items is allowed outside of battle. |
| You may leave to use the PC (as long as you have defeated all mandatory trainers), but you may not return to fight the trainers for experience. |
| All items hidden and visible must be picked up before leaving a Segment, or else they are forfeited. |
| Any picked up item must be followed by an immediate decision if required. |
| Wild pokemon may not be fought for experience unless allowed by a Prize. |
| There is NO step farming allowed. This is applicable to moves like “Return”, or Friendship Evolution Pokemon. Also note: step items are disallowed in RogueMon. |

---

## GYMS
| **Every trainer must be fought in the gym.** |
| :--------------------: |
| The Gym Leader’s ace will always be holding a sensible item. |
| Gym Leader TM must be decided to teach at time of acquisition. |
| Upon Beating the Gym, Immediately Get your TM, Badge Cap Increases, then a random prize choice. You may look at and decide on the prize and the TM in either order, however you must decide on both before you do anything else. Afterwards comes *Buy Phase* and *Cleansing phase*. |

---

## BUY PHASE
| **You may *exchange* your current HP heals for HP heals of EQUAL TO or LESS THAN the healing existing in your bag. This is limited to your game progression in terms of what healing is unlocked for purchase.** |
| :--------------------: |
| Max Potions and Full Restores cannot be used in Shop Phase. |
| Current HP total does not apply when exchanging HP heals. i.e. Hyper can always be exchanged for 200. |
| You may exchange your current status heals. Specific status heals (Antidote, Ice Heal, etc.) may be exchanged 1 for 1; you may also exchange any 3 status heals for a Full Heal or vice versa. |

---

## CLEANSING PHASE
| **You must purge items from all pockets in your game that were found on the ground since the last gym. Unless, you are permitted to keep them via Prize. Any item you have claimed from a prize is owned, and not cleansed.** |
| :--------------------: |
| The following items will never be cleansed: 
Repels 
Pokeballs
Heals (PP, HP, status)
Battle items you have unlocked via Prize
Held items you have unlocked via Prize
TMs you have unlocked via Prize (However, you will need a seperate prize to *Teach* the TM). 
Anything you earned from the Shop phase or Prize.
You may keep any found Roguestones (evolves all stone/item evolution pokemon).
Poke Dolls, Smoke Balls, and Fluffy Tails are allowed and can be kept. |

---

## CURSES

| **Curses are a feature, in a state of continuous development. Segments will be randomly chosen at the beginning of the run to be cursed. You will be able to see which segments are cursed, but not know the specific curse until you start the segment. These curses will have a temporary negative effect that applies during the segment, although some may have permanent consequences.** |
