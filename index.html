    <h1>-FAQ-</h1>
        
    <section>
        <h1>What influences attempt count the most?</h1>
        <p>In Kaizo/Super Kaizo, labs are way more unforgiving. Only like 35% of attempts make it out. In Roguemon this will be much higher by virtue of babies vs babies.</p>
        <p>Pivoting deaths are way more likely in kaizo since any BST can be in the grass. IronMon is also Not 100% catchrate, high BST mons possible likely to 1-shot you. You're also limited to 3 catches before starting your run, and 1 per route/area. So you're much less likely to see a 'runnable' pokemon.</p>
        <p>In Roguemon, the run is just as likely to die to Brock as it is to Route 24/25, Koga, E4, etc. Linear difficulty instead of spiked. So by virtue of being on runs more, you're more likely to make it far and possibly win.</p>
        <p>Guaranteed items with Routes as segment, i think, is an equal trade off., probably slightly favored to making RogueMon slightly 'easier' than IronMon.</p>
        <p>Held items and cutting out tons of EXP (boat, routes 12-15, swimmers etc.) should trade off nicely in terms of RogueMon = IronMon for difficulty.</p>
    </section>
        
    
    <section>
        <h1>Difficulty equivalence?</h1>
        <p>Ascension 1 is closer to "Ultimate IronMon".</p>
        <p>Ascension 2, and Kaizo IronMon are similar difficulty, but you're also likely to win in less 'attempts'. </p>
        <p>Ascension 3 hasnt had much testing, and is still in development, with that said it will likely fall between Kaizo IronMon and Super Kaizo IronMon.</p>

        <h1>Questioned asked</h1>
        <p>Q : In A1 when can you equip the lucky egg?</p>
        <p>A : You can equip it as soon as you get it, but after you beat Brock it's gotta go.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Q : I'm struggling with getting RogueMon running</p>
        <p>A : The discord is currently the best place to get any help, it has many resources and you are free to ask questions</p>

        <p><strong>Once you fight a non-rival trainer, you are LOCKED with your current pokemon for the attempt.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If you do happen to defeat a wild, you cannot run the pokemon that gained experience.</strong></p>
